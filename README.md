# Web-Scrapper-For-My-School-Stuff
School Websites Web Scarpper allows a user to open up websites, particular ones for school, and it logins in for them in a nice fast manner.



The Pyhton Modules I used were Selenium for the webscaping, pyatugui so I could click on certain buttons on the websites, and threading so I could piece together everthing.

import threading 
from threading import Thread
import pyautogui

from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains
